# 1-Word-Story-Bot
This is a bot made for Tritho's Tree --> https://discord.gg/VhVZDvPaQF

really inefficient code (i suck at js and programming in general)

I didn't include some of the fun commands in the file because they are supposed to be secret (try ;suragivemod)


Changelog{

v1: "added 1 word story function (deletes message if it has a space in it), 
    added a ;code command to provide a link to this github page",
    
v2: "added ;setblacklist function and deletes the message sent by the user if it contains a blacklisted word",

v3: "changed ;setblacklist function to ;blacklist, \n
    added ;unblacklist function to remove blacklists, \n
    added ;blacklistlist command so you can see the words that are blacklisted, \n
    added ;mod to check whether the user has moderator (testing feature), \n
    added ;help command which sends an embedded message explaining the main commands, \n
    added ;generaterobux command so you can generate some of that sweet, free robux, \n
    added ;generate command so you can generate anything that you want (i wish i could generate efficiency), \n
    added ;maxitbroken command which pings me if an error occurs" \n
}
